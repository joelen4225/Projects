# Projects
This branch is for:
- CS1111: Intro to Programming Final Project (November 2021, Freshmen Year of College)

My partner and I aimed to recreate PacMan but with the schools in the ACC. UVA acted as our PacMan and the four other schools (Virginia Tech, UNC, Duke, and Louisville) acted as our ghosts. We received a 96 on this project.
