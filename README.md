- CS50: Introduction to Computer Science Final Project (May 2020, Junior Year of High School)

It is key to note that this template was eventually used to make 4 public websites (that have since been archived). 3 of those websites were normal e-commerce sites, meant to give the company owner more freedom and personalization than if they were to use Shopify or Wix. The 4th site was for a volunteering organization looking to increase members and retention to the program.
