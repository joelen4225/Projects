This branch is for:
- CS3140: Software Development Essentials Wordle Project (May 2023, Sophomore Year of College)

We were tasked with improving a project earlier in the semester which included creating a Wordle replica in the Java terminal. We had to recreate the GUI and make it look as close to the web application as possible. Our team received a 100 on this project.
